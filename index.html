                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    I'm a self-taught 19 years old italian C++ hobbyist who is starting to 
                    learn about webdev. 
                    <h2>What was my course of studying?</h2>
                    I started learning programming near the end of middle school with Python,
                    then moved to Java and Windows Batch scripting language only to 
                    finally settle with C++.
                    <h2>What am I focusing at now?</h2>
                    At the moment, I'm trying to learn about webdev while developing the 
                    infrastructure for a singleplayer/multiplayer game, <em>tanca</em>. 
                    <h3>Other interests?</h3>
                    Music, japanese language.
